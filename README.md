This is a Python-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a user's favorite movie. The system uses a similarity matrix to compare movies and recommend the most relevant ones.

## Features ‚ú®
- Input a movie title, and the system will recommend similar movies.
- Uses a similarity score based on movie metadata such as genres, ratings, etc.
- Capable of handling close matches even if the user input isn't perfectly accurate.

## How It Works üîç
1. **User Input**: The user enters their favorite movie.
2. **Find Close Match**: The system finds the closest matching movie in the dataset.
3. **Calculate Similarity**: Using a precomputed similarity matrix, the system calculates similarity scores for other movies.
4. **Recommendation**: It then displays the top 30 similar movies based on the similarity score.
